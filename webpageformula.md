
currenlty looking at about page,
made the max-width 700px for text-lines
when text compromises closely with compression we have 
400px media query that makes the image appear above the text, to ust the vertical height

our nav bar seems to work great
we have the customer on the bottom of the page, the width there is too big with a lot of compression

make as little code as possible, start makin p tags a h tags the same and make it fit the page
h tags are usually outside of a div, they describe the seciton they are in, all h tags and p tags, the same, and then a few places like the p text to fit with the image and the customers who need a really short text line to stay inside of the div, altough things like blkack tone, max-width and size remains
also check sections and their names

remove yellow color on white background, dark colors on white background
check that font is inherit * * *
check all that is decided on the most important style sheet, style.css 

check how little is in index.css

make all fonts super dark towards the white, give page distinct layouts, separate by divs, so you can easily acess a div with a good name and change it without the rest of tower falling

have good separations and create layouts,. front page grrid, utilises space, div, auto gives the divs space

how wide text length
we have to make the image appear underneath
about us text when the width of the viewport is like 400px








now, we have sections for different reach on the webpage, our welcoming content that talks about our page "amazing rexipes at the tip of your finger" "View our most popular recipe" ----that's the instant welcoming into the page

then when a section ends another immediatelty begins, each sections with it's own h tag, the first has a h1 "authentic handmade guitars- ---- then all the others that belong to a section are h2

the last section ends right before the main ends, the main ends right before the footer
then we have the script links right before the body, tbody before the html xclsoiung tag



i have now supervised the index.html page: notes:: the css is style instead of the recommended styles (with an s) ---be aware of all the tags neseccary for an image, like this::   <img src="images/review-bio2.jpg" alt="Profile picture of Bob Willis" class="review__images" />
---check the alt image text, every image needs that, every sections needs a probable name, something that makes sense
we open the page inside the header, the header is the nav and end right before the header closing tage that enbds before the main, and the beginning of the main is a section class with the name wlecome and a div class with the name welcome__content, then our first and only h1 for that page, the rest of the sections are descirbed byu a h2
