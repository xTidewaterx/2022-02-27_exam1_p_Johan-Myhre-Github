i made it so that the divs had their heights
with their heights
they now had asserted, speicifed heights, now the margin on the butto nwas relative to the divs blocks stacked on top, top to bottom
now the button had something to relate it's margin to
things need to be tnagible for it to develop witth the elements objects araray of the othersss

a block level element occupies the netire horizontal space of it's parent element (container
, and verticcal space equal to the height of it's contents, thereby creating a block.
an inline lement only occcupy the space bounded by the tags defining the elemnts
instead of breaking the flow of the content

For ltr scripts, content flows horizontally from left to right. For rtl scripts, content flows horizontally from right to left. The next horizontal line is positioned below the previous line.

content flows from left to right

 A block-level element always starts on a new line and takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).

 by default block-level elements begin on new line
 but inline elements can start anywhere in a line

with fractions we experience that the content adapts organically, we can specify a size and whatever is left will be filled by the content assigned to be the only fraction, the 1fr.

i made the logo utilise a minial amount of the topline
now the position absolute means it disreagards nayhting on it's side, it's space it oblivious to any changes around it, now position sticky, sticks to the top, and dissapears up there, it is a matter of realisation reality disorietnation, this leaves with that
