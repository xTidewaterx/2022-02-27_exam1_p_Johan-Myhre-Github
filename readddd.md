                position: relative;    
                float: none;
                margin: 20px;
                margin: 0 auto;
                display: flex;
                width: 100px;
               
                    
            }
            
            this changes the position to be on top as it gives room underneath




we have a games.forEach(function(game){
    container.innerHTML += `<a href="details.html?id=${game.id}" class="card">
    <div class="image" style="background-image: url(${game.backrgound_image});"></div></a>`;
});

} ---- we write the forEach function in the same way, we then have curly braces with container.innerHTML += ``    now inside of the innerhtml we begin by wrapping each of those classes we create with a details.html page route, then that url is also added a query string that says id= ---this id is then assigned the value =${game.id}
